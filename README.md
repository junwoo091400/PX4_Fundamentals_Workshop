## About the Workshop

 Have you struggled with getting started in PX4 Development? Did you ever get stuck after running the example in the user doc and couldn't develop what you wanted? This workshop explains all the essential concepts and knowledge you need to get started with PX4 Autopilot Development!

In this workshop, you will learn the core concepts in PX4 like NuttX, Modules, Drivers, uORB, and Parameters. We will show you how to set up a development environment using Docker and program a small custom module, compile it, and test using SITL (Software-In-The-Loop Simulation) to verify its behavior and intuitively understand how a module works.

We will also construct a more advanced module that will require more advanced concepts like Work Queue, Scheduling, MAVLink, and more. With this process, you will gain tangible insight into constructing a proper module that does more than one task. Finally, we will demonstrate uploading the custom modules into actual Hardware.

We will also share tips and tricks that will make your PX4 development experience more pleasant, and we will stick around to answer as many questions as possible in the time we have.
